# Strange Questions

Strange Questions is an app designed to start interesting conversations. 

It's a mix between "shower thoughts" and lateral thinking, with big questions and small questions about the world around us and the choices that we make every day. 

Creativity flourishes within constraints so thatâ€™s why we added a timer for each question! Some questions might seem silly at first, but if you give them a few seconds, you might discover that they lead you to strange and wonderful conversations. 

The questions are selected at random and they are regularly updated to keep the set fresh and interesting.
